# MySQL Learning Notes

This repository contains my SQL scripts created while following the
"MySQL Beginner to Advanced" YouTube course by Alex The Analyst.

The files `01 - Select.sql` to `15 - Triggers and Events.sql`
are practice scripts for different SQL topics:
SELECT / WHERE / JOINs / UNION / CASE / SUBQUERIES /
WINDOW FUNCTIONS / CTEs / TEMP TABLES / STORED PROCEDURES / TRIGGERS.

Files `16 - Data Cleaning.sql` and `17 - Exploratory Data Analysis.sql`
are mini-projects where I clean and analyze a real layoffs dataset.

This repo is for learning purposes only.
For portfolio-oriented SQL projects, see my other repositories.
